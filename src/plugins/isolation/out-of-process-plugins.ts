/**
 * Which plugins load in their own process.
 *
 * It is EMPTY, and empty is the whole point right now: the child runtime and
 * the reverse channel exist, nothing routes to them, and the app behaves exactly
 * as it did. Populating this set one id at a time is how the isolated path gets
 * exercised by real plugins before an untrusted one is ever admitted to it.
 *
 * NO CONFIGURATION READS THIS. Not an environment variable, not a settings key,
 * not a manifest field. A plugin moves out-of-process when a reviewed commit
 * adds its id here, which means the move is visible in a diff and revertable by
 * a revert. An env-var switch would let the boundary change under a user with
 * no record of it, and a manifest field would let the PLUGIN choose whether it
 * is isolated — which is the one party that must not have a say.
 *
 * This is a routing decision, not a fallback: a call never retries in-process
 * when the child fails. A failed child fails the call
 * (`docs/blueprints/plugin-process-isolation.md` §9, "A note on the coexistence
 * question").
