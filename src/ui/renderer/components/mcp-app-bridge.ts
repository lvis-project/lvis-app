/**
 * Production host-side wiring for one MCP App card: `AppBridge` + transport.
 *
 * Extracted from `McpAppView.tsx` on purpose. This is the code that actually decides
 * whether an MCP App works — the constructor argument order, the sandbox handshake,
 * the `resources/read` proxy, the `connect()` call — and the real-<webview> e2e gate
 * (`test/e2e/ui/mcp-app-handshake/`) imports THIS module so it exercises the shipping
 * wiring rather than a look-alike reimplementation.
 *
 * That distinction is not academic. The gate previously stood up its own AppBridge, so
 * it proved the architecture end-to-end while proving nothing about how the renderer
 * wired it: drop the `onsandboxready` assignment or swap two constructor args and the
 * product would be dead with the gate still green. Keeping this in a React-free module
 * (no react / lucide / i18n imports) is what lets the e2e page bundle import the real
 * thing.
 *
 * The individual handler BODIES live one-per-file under `mcp-app-bridge/handlers/`;
 * this module is the single wiring surface that computes host capabilities from the
 * active handler set and registers every handler before `connect()`.

 * invisible to TypeScript here (`skipLibCheck` merely hides the .d.ts error). Members
 * declared directly on `AppBridge` resolve fine, so every handler below uses the

 * listener semantics, and the runtime JS is unaffected. Reverts to `addEventListener`
 * once modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps#705 lands. NOT worth forking.
