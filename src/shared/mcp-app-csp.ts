/**
 * MCP-App Content Security Policy — single source of truth.
 *
 * Built in the MAIN process ONLY, from the RESOURCE's own `_meta.ui.csp` that main
 * just fetched via `resources/read`. It is emitted as the sandbox-proxy document's
 * `Content-Security-Policy` **response header**.
 *
 * ─── Why main, and never the renderer ────────────────────────────────────────
 * This CSP is the containment boundary for code we do not trust (server-authored
 * HTML). Its input must therefore never round-trip through the renderer: a
 * compromised renderer could forge a permissive policy object and widen the very
 * envelope that contains the untrusted app. Derive it in main; never accept it
 * renderer-forwarded.
 *
 * ─── Why the header is the effective ceiling (measured, not assumed) ─────────
 * The app HTML runs in an inner `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
 * srcdoc=...>`. A `srcdoc` document INHERITS the embedding document's CSP, and a `<meta>` CSP
 * inside it can only ever INTERSECT — narrow, never widen. Verified in a real
 * Electron <webview>: with the proxy header at `img-src 'none'`, an inner frame
 * whose own meta declared `img-src data:` was still blocked, citing the OUTER policy.
 *
 * Consequence: the header IS the ceiling, so it must be built **per resource** —
 * restrictive default + ONLY that resource's declared domains. A blanket permissive
 * superset would silently grant every app every other app's allowances, violating
 * the spec's No-Loosening MUST (the host MUST NOT allow undeclared domains).
 *
 * ─── Spec shape: domain BUCKETS, not directive names ─────────────────────────
 * `McpUiResourceCsp` declares `connectDomains` / `resourceDomains` / `frameDomains`
 * / `baseUriDomains`. The previous host type was keyed by CSP *directive* names
 * (`scriptSrc`/`connectSrc`/…), so a spec-conformant server's `connectDomains` was
 * silently DROPPED. Consuming the spec shape is what fixes that.
 *
 * Note `frame-ancestors` is only meaningful in a header (it is spec-ignored in a
 * `<meta>`). In a <webview> the proxy is a TOP-LEVEL browsing context, so it has no
 * ancestors and the directive is inert — verified: `frame-ancestors 'none'` does not
 * block the proxy. Kept as deliberate defense-in-depth.
 */
import type { McpUiResourceCsp } from "../mcp/types.js";

/**
 * Restrictive floor. Every network-capable directive starts at `'none'`; only the
 * resource's own declared domains open it.
 *
 * `'unsafe-inline'` for script/style is intentional and is not the hole here: inline
 * script is how MCP Apps are authored, and the frame has no reachable same-origin
 * SERVER endpoint to fetch from — the proxy origin it now shares (`allow-same-origin`)
 * serves only the host-generated, script-free proxy document, and the network gate
 * blocks every origin the resource did not declare. `data:`/`blob:` are local, not
 * exfiltration channels. There is deliberately NO `https:` wildcard and NO hardcoded
 * CDN allowlist — either would let any app reach hosts it never declared.
