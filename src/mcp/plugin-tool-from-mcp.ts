/**
 * Reverse projection: a first-party plugin's discovered MCP `Tool` (from its
 * loopback `tools/list`) → the canonical {@link Tool} the §6.4 ToolRegistry and
 * the permission pipeline consume. The symmetric inverse of
 * `plugin-server-projection.ts` (manifest → MCP tool).
 *
 * Half of the `plugin-loopback-server` milestone (docs/architecture/mcp-alignment-design.md §5):
 * a migrated plugin's `pathFields` is read back from the tool's reverse-DNS
 * `_meta["xyz.lvis/pathFields"]`, NOT from a second direct manifest read; the
 * manifest is projected to MCP exactly once (forward).
 *
 * #885: per-tool `category` is REMOVED from the contract (Q3). The in-process
 * loopback forward projection emits none; an out-of-process plugin may still put
 * `_meta["xyz.lvis/category"]` on the wire, but the host does NOT trust it — this
 * reverse projection ignores any wire category and registers the write-equivalent
 * default-strict baseline, with the effective category derived host-side per
 * invocation.
 * `writesToOwnSandbox` is no longer promoted (the reviewer auto-LOW keys on the
 * host-computed sandbox-containment). The per-tool `version`/`deprecatedSince`/
 * `replacedBy` fields left the Tool contract entirely (Phase-R deletions), so the
 * wire carries none and this reverse projection reads none.
 *
 * Trust boundary: `_meta["xyz.lvis/workerId"]` is intentionally NOT promoted to
 * `Tool.workerId` here. Loopback `tools/call` executes through
 * pluginRuntime.call(), not through a host-routed ASRT worker. Treating a
 * manifest-declared worker id as execution proof would let a plugin
 * self-attest ASRT confinement and relax reviewer risk for an unconfined call.
 *
 * Why this is NOT `mcp-tool-adapter.ts`: that adapter handles EXTERNAL/untrusted
 * MCP servers, which are foreign network peers → hardcoded `category:"network"`,
 * `source:"mcp"`, and the `mcp_{server}_` namespace. A first-party plugin's
 * loopback server is the SAME plugin: it keeps its natural tool name (no
 * namespace), `source:"plugin"`, and its `pluginId`. Neither adapter trusts a
 * plugin's self-declared category — this one applies the default-strict `"write"`
 * baseline; they otherwise diverge because the trust models differ.
 *
 * DEFAULT-STRICT (host-classifies-risk, project_permission_review_redesign):
 * #885 — the host does NOT trust a plugin's self-declared per-tool category.
 * The in-process loopback forward projection stopped emitting
 * `_meta["xyz.lvis/category"]`, and an out-of-process plugin that still puts one
 * on the wire is ignored too, so this reverse projection unconditionally
 * registers the write-equivalent default-strict baseline. A plugin grading its
 * own danger is not a control (MCP spec: a server can lie); the effective
 * category is derived host-side per invocation (`inspectHostRisk`), never from a
 * plugin self-declaration.
