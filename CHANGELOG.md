# Changelog

## #893 — login-and-secret-allowlist

### M1 — perm-revoke → bearer-abort wiring

- `PermissionManager` now owns per-plugin `AbortController`s and exposes
  `getPluginRevokeSignal(pluginId)` + `revokePluginAccess(pluginId, reason)`.
- The three persisted-mutation entry points (`addAlwaysAllowedPersist`,
  `addAlwaysDeniedPersist`, `removeRule`) call `revokeAllPluginAccess(...)`
  after their broadcast so outstanding `hostApi.resolveApiKey` bearers are
  aborted on any rule change.
- `resolve-api-key.ts` accepts a `getPluginRevokeSignal` dep and merges it
  with the caller's request signal via `AbortSignal.any` so the returned
  bearer's `release()` fires on whichever signal aborts first.
- Boot wiring threads the live `PermissionManager` into `initPluginRuntime`
  → per-plugin `resolveApiKey` host implementation.

Before this change, `broadcastConfigChanged` notified the renderer config tab
but did NOT signal aborting plugins' in-flight bearers. The `release()`
listener inside `resolve-api-key.ts` was dead weight because no upstream
caller wired the controller. A plugin that captured the bearer in a closure
could continue calling the upstream provider after the user revoked access.

### M2 — demo snapshot expiry documented

- `marketplace-whitelist.demo.json` retains `expiresAt: 2030-01-01` AS-IS.
  This is INTENTIONAL — kiosk / trade-show machines run the bundled snapshot
  for the lifetime of the signed app binary, so a short expiry would brick
  long offline deployments.
- Production catalog (live `lvis-project/marketplace-whitelist` repo) uses
  a rolling 90-day expiry and is fetched + verified at boot via
  `whitelist-fetcher.ts`. The demo path is gated behind
  `LVIS_DEMO_ENABLED=1` so production builds never load the demo snapshot.
- Comment header added near the demo-snapshot loader in
  `src/plugins/whitelist/whitelist-registry.ts` documenting the policy.

### Optional — whitelist-bootstrap shutdown signal

- `wireWhitelistRegistry` accepts an optional `appShutdownSignal: AbortSignal`
  that is threaded through to the whitelist fetch so app-quit during a slow
  CDN response unblocks boot/shutdown without waiting up to 10s for the HTTP
  timeout.
