# Permission Policy Design

This document describes the current permission-policy contract for LVIS tool
execution. Korean source history is preserved at
[docs/ko/architecture/permission-policy-design.md](../ko/architecture/permission-policy-design.md).

## Purpose

The permission system prevents tools from executing merely because an LLM or a
plugin requested them. The host classifies the request, applies hard safety
rules, asks the user or reviewer where required, and records the result.

## Policy Inputs

| Input | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Tool source | Builtin, plugin, or MCP. Used for display and audit; not a bypass. |
| Tool category | Read, write, shell, network, browser, meta, or other declared categories. |
| Trust origin | User keyboard, LLM tool argument, plugin UI, local API, routine, or headless task. |
| Project context | Normalized project root/name used for scope and audit. |
| Policy mode | Default, strict, auto-review, or allow mode. |
| Execution surface | Foreground chat, detached view, background routine, plugin surface, or local API. |

## Decision Order

1. Validate the tool exists in the registry.
2. Validate the schema, category, and path fields declared by the provider.
3. Apply hard-deny rules: sensitive paths, invalid manifests, sandbox limits,
   explicit deny policies, and unsafe origin combinations.
4. Resolve policy mode.
5. If reviewer mode is active, request a reviewer verdict for eligible calls.
6. Route to user approval, inline allow, deferred queue, or deny.
7. Execute only after the decision is resolved.
8. Write audit data for allow, ask, deny, deferred, reviewer unavailable, and
   reviewer failure outcomes.

Hard-deny rules always run before reviewer or user approval. A user approval
does not make an invalid tool definition valid.

## Policy Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Default | Allows low-risk workspace reads; asks for mutation, network, shell, and out-of-scope access. |
| Strict | Asks for reads as well as mutation. Useful for high-control sessions. |
| Auto-review | Uses the reviewer for eligible write/network/shell calls. Low can pass inline, medium/high ask or defer. |
| Allow | Allows after hard gates and audit. It does not bypass sensitive paths, invalid manifests, or sandbox rules. |

## Foreground And Headless Behavior

Foreground requests can show an approval modal because the user is present.
Headless requests must not interrupt the user with surprise modals. Non-low
headless requests move to the deferred queue and surface through a queue button
or history view.

Closing a deferred modal does not grant permission and does not delete the audit
record. It leaves the item pending or closed according to the queue state.

## Reviewer Failure

Reviewer failure is not a silent allow. If the provider is missing, times out, or
returns malformed output, the host fails closed:

- foreground calls ask the user with explicit reviewer-unavailable context;
- headless calls defer or deny according to configured failure behavior;
- audit records include the reviewer failure path.

## Plugin And MCP Tools

Plugins and MCP servers use the same path as builtin tools. The tool provider
must declare schemas and categories. The host may display provider-specific
metadata, but policy logic remains category- and origin-driven.

Low-trust MCP tools cannot lower their risk solely through a reviewer verdict
when hard policy requires explicit approval.

## Local API Permission Mutation

Local API calls that mutate permission mode route through the approval gate as
agent actions. The renderer-facing reason defaults to English. The gate owns the
final explicitness requirements and denial behavior.

## Audit Requirements

Audit records should include:

- tool name and source;
- category and permission mode;
- trust origin;
- project identity when available;
- decision and decision reason;
- reviewer verdict or reviewer failure state;
- deferred queue state for headless requests.

Audit records must not contain raw secrets or unnecessary private payload data.

## Test Coverage

The permission scenario board and unit tests under `src/permissions/__tests__`
encode the expected behavior for default, strict, auto-review, reviewer
failures, invalid plugin manifests, MCP tools, overlay prompt imports, and
headless deferred queue behavior.
